## About

Hi there! You just stepped on one of my beautiful tools. This one is pretty small and lightweight actually. It's just a small package that lets you create people profiles for your game. Before going further, let's see how to get it working.

## Getting Started

First of all, there are no prerequisites. This package does not depend on anything else. Installing the package itself will be enough to get it working.

## Installing

Well, this is a it package. This means that you can install it directly with the **Package Manager**.

>[!TIP]
>To open up the **Package Manager**, you should go to **"Window/Package Manager"** option on the Unity's toolbar and just press it.

## Usage

Okay, now I suppose you have the package installed. Let me give you some more information about the person profiles. These profiles are stored in **scriptable objects** so that you can use them in nearly every system you will write for your game. They also have their custom editors. So if you want to modify the person script itself, you should also modify the custom editor script.

>[!TIP]
>You can create a new person via: **"Create/absencee_/Person"** menu option in the project window. You can find it at the very top of the menu.

## Wrapping up

Well, you've done it! Like I said, this one is pretty simple to setup and also pretty easy to use. I hope it helps you throughout your journey of game development, buddy. Have a nice day!
