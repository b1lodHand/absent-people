## About

Hi there! You just stepped on one of my beautiful tools. This one is pretty small and lightweight actually. It's just a small package that lets you create people profiles for your game. Those profiles are stored in scriptable objects so you that you can use them in nearly every system you will write for your game. So, let's see how to get it working.

## Getting Started
