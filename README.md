## About

Hi there! You just stepped on one of my beautiful tools. This one is pretty small and lightweight actually. It's just a small package that lets you create people profiles for your game. Before going further, let's see how to get it working.

## Getting Started

First of all, there are no prerequisites. This package does not depend on anything else. Installing the package itself will be enough to get it working.

## Installing

Well, this is a it package. This means that you can install it directly with the **Package Manager**.

>[!TIP]
>To open up the **Package Manager**, you should go to **"Window/Package Manager"** option on the Unity's toolbar and just press it.

## Usage

Okay, now I suppose you have the package installed. Now the only thing you need to know is that the person profiles are stored in **scriptable objects**. And that's it.

>[!CAUTION]
>Person script also has a custom editor script. So if you want to modify the person script itself, you should also modify the one for the custom editor.

>[!TIP]
>You can create a new person via: **"Create/absencee_/Person"** menu option in the project window. You can find it at the very top of the menu.

## Wrapping up

Well, you've done it! Like I said, this one is pretty simple to setup and also pretty easy to use. I hope it helps you throughout your journey of game development, buddy. Have a nice day!
